## **Installation**:

**1. Download Node.js**
      If you have homebrew, you can simply type `brew install node` into a terminal prompt.
      If you don't have homebrew, go [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and pick the appropriate pre-built install for your machine.
      
**2. Download the hapnhen directory.**
      Click on the button "Download Zip" at the top right of the hapnhen github directory.
      
**3. Install dependencies.**
      Open up a terminal prompt and change directories into the hapnhen directory you just downloaded.
      To change directories, type `cd </path/to/file>` where "<path/to/file>" is replaced by the actual path to the hapnhen directory on your machine.
      
      Once in the hapnhen directory type `npm install` into a terminal prompt to install the dependencies for the project.
**4. Run a local server.**
      While still in the hapnhen directory, type `node index` into the terminal.
      You should see a line that says "Server Started" after a second or too.
      Congrats! Your local server is up and running!
      
**5. Visit the webpage.**
